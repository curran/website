  "body": "**Starting January 2019**\n\n_I wanted to formalize my creative practices by getting in the habit of publishing them and writing about them publicly. I have the bad habit of making things and texting a photo to one friend and then shoving them away in a folder somewhere. _\n\n_I've tried not to set too many rules for myself, other than to try and create something every day. I want to try a wide array of different small-to-medium projects using different processes and materials. The goal is to start getting in the habit of documenting my work as well as the decisions that went into the process of creating them. _\n\n_I will be updating this post with each creation, newest at the top. Wish me luck!_",
