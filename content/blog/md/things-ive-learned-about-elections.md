# Things I've learned about elections

## Edge cases
Elections are all edge cases. Votes are cast and tallied by a wide variety of Americans who all have the same goal but often different ideas about how to go about it. Votes are cast in cities and rural areas, in places with millions of constituents or dozens. Many elections are run locally by someone you should mentally picture as your well-meaning aunt. The sheer scale of such an operation is astounding. We live in a country that spans a continent and [9 time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US-Timezones-post-2007.png). 

This great country contains lots of different people with lots of different ways about going things.

## Election day
We have grown accustomed to live results of elections. This is definitely not something our grandfathers had and is mind-bogglingly complex once you start to think about it. 

With American elections “live” does not mean getting the results of votes immediately after they are cast. The closest we can get for now is seeing vote results as they are counted after polls close. [^0] 

The basic rules around voting are laid out in the constitution[^1] but a remarkable amount of the nitty-gritty details are [left up to each state](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/voting-laws-roundup-2019) to figure out. 

On election day in America, polls open [at a particular time and close at a particular time. Those times, like almost everything else, [depend on where you’re talking about](https://ballotpedia.org/State_Poll_Opening_and_Closing_Times_(2019)) and can vary even within a single state and could change any year. 

## Races
Any particular office (be it a Senate or a President or local Sheriff) has a variety of candidates from a variety of parties. Generally we think of races as between two front runners. But this is more a matter of culture and simplification than reality. 

Here’s what we can agree on: A **race** is run by *n* number of **candidates** for a single **office**.[^2] 

Every [eligible(!)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_rights_in_the_United_States) person who lives in the area that candidate [represents](https://ballotpedia.org/Who_represents_me) (districts for the house, states for senators, the entire country for presidents) gets to vote between the candidates running for each office that represents them. [^4]

For example the [2016 Presidential Race](https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_election,_2016) had four[^3] candidates; Clinton, Trump, Stein, and Johnson running for the office of president.

## Voting
Constituents show up to their polling place. Or, well, [sort of](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx). [39 states](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx#overview) have mechanisms for early voting, 28 allow no-excuse absentee votes, 19 allow voting with an accepted excuse. [36 million people voted early in the midterm election.](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/05/early-voting-turnout-2018-elections-midterms-963149) - that’s about 30% of the [117 million](http://www.electproject.org/2018g) total votes cast. 

## Election data
Once a vote is cast, ballots are counted and the counts are delivered to a central location and the numbers are reported in regular intervals (usually). That is all handled by state and local governments. 

The media (and by extension, the public) are given access to the vote counts at this point. Often times you can find a website run by the Secretary of State which will have the latest results for different statewide elections. 

## Primary elections
In addition to the general elections that gather the most attention, parties hold their own elections to decide who will run against the other party, the [primaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election). 

These primaries can take [various forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election#Primaries_in_the_United_States) including: uncontested (no challenger) or runoff/[Louisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_primary)/[blanket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisan_blanket_primary). They can be [open or closed, partially open, partially closed, etc…](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/primary-types.aspx) - remember, [edge cases](#edge-cases).

## Voting machines
Voting machine security in the United States is currently [a joke](https://www.wired.com/story/voting-machine-vulnerabilities-defcon-voting-village/).[^5] The joke is not funny when you consider the real-world impact of such an important lever of our society left comically unguarded. 

The [OSET Institute](https://www.osetfoundation.org/) has compiled some data and an excellent team to work on the technology used for American elections, including defending from [threats of cyberterrorism](https://www.osetfoundation.org/research/2019/02/10/electioncyberterrorism). 

## Coverage of elections
In 2018 I did some design research (captured in a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/mrejfox/status/1021951616482795521?s=20)) and went through some old footage of NBC election coverage. We were even to incorporate the effect of [numbers counting up](https://twitter.com/mrejfox/status/1021953888411430912) as they changed into the 2018 version of the Big Board. 

I had the fortune to join a politics-covering media organization in 2016, a year when suddenly there was intense interest in how media organizations covered politics. Many feel the media failed in the coverage of the 2016 election.

I think it is worthwhile to listen to those criticisms and [think of ways](http://pressthink.org/2018/11/election-coverage-the-road-not-taken/) that things might be improved. 

But we have a rat’s nests of problems to untangle from [horse race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_race_journalism) coverage (which [might be good!](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1081180x98003004004)) to televised debates, [election polling](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/) methodologies, and the ways polls should be covered. 

### Horse race election coverage
Jack Shafer wrote in Politico about why [horse race election coverage might be good](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/01/09/why-horse-race-political-journalism-awesome-223867). 

 > By giving voters a window on the closed world of insider politics, horse-race stories help focus reader attention on the races. Without the work of election handicappers, coverage would come to resemble an endless series of policy white papers that nobody reads. The presidential campaign has another 22 months to run, leaving plenty of time and space to explore the contest from multiple perspectives. 

### 2001 election night
A CNN internal report called their own election night coverage in 2001 [“a disaster”](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/03/us/report-calls-networks-election-night-coverage-a-disaster.html).

> Following the election night coverage – in which CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and MSNBC all made wrong calls on the Florida vote – several networks ordered investigations of their coverage.

> Based largely on exit polling, the networks first declared Mr. Gore the winner in Florida, only to give the state to Mr. Bush later. Ultimately the networks backed off again, declaring the race undecided.

The coverage of 2001’s presidential election lead to executives from CBS, CNN, Fox, NBC, and the AP being [called to testify in front of congress](https://www.rcfp.org/networks-answer-congress-election-night-coverage/) by committee chair “Billy” Tauzin (R-La.). 

> Much of the testimony focused on the networks’ reliance on exit polls and the flaws in the VNS system of conducting the polls.

> Tauzin introduced legislation to create a uniform poll closing time across the country and asked the networks to voluntarily resist projecting winners until 9 p.m. EST. In a concession, all the networks said they will refrain from calling a state until all the polls in the particular state have closed.

## Why do we have elections on Tuesdays?
It could be argued that it would make more sense for elections to be held [on the weekend](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/4183/text). 

## Resources
+ [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/) is an exceptional source of all of the strange little constantly-changing details about elections, freely editable like Wikipedia. 





[^0]: This makes sense, when you think about it. There is reason to believe if you could turn on your TV and see how your candidate was doing, if you could see the vote counts live and your candidate was safely ahead, you might decide it’s not even worth going out and casting a vote.

[^1]: [Article 1 of the Constitution](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/articles/article-i#elections-clause) “The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States…” - [Section 4](https://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec4.html): “The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.”

[^2]: Well, sort of, remember what I said about [edge cases](#edge-cases)? There are four more additional candidates who [“made more than 15 percent of general election ballots”](https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_candidates,_2016#Candidates_by_state_primary_ballot) 

[^3]: Four additional candidates appeared on some ballots but not all: Darrell Lane Castle (Constitution Party), Rocky De La Fuente (Reform Party), Evan McMullin (Independent), Gloria Estela La Riva (Party for Socialism and Liberation)

[^4]: The election of Senators was not always given to the population in general. The framer’s constitution [left that to the states](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Feature_Homepage_ElectedStateLegislatures.htm). “The framers believed that in electing senators, state legislatures would cement their ties with the national government. They also expected that senators elected by state legislatures would be freed from pressures of public opinion and therefore better able to concentrate on legislative business and serve the needs of each state. In essence, senators would serve as “states’ ambassadors” to the federal government.” - it turned out to not work well because states never got around to electing them.
